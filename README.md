# html-refactor

## Description 

I have refactored the given HTML code to improve accessibility, readability and search engine optimisation, as below:

### HTML Changes:
* Added title
* Added alt text to all images and icons
* Removed redundant img closer tag
* Ensured all IDs were correct so links worked
* Compounded classes in both main and aside sections to "type-of-service" and "benefit"
* Amended footer and header div tags with classes to header and footer tags respectively
* Replaced various other tags as follows:
    * div tag inside header to nav
    * div tag with class "content" changed to main tag
    * all div children of main changed to section tag
    * div tag with class "benefits" changed to aside tag
    * all div children of aforementioned aside changed to section tag

### CSS Changes:
* Updated aforementioned div classes to their updated tags (header, footer, nav, section and aside)
* Reordered code so type-of-service was before benefit to match html
* added comments to CSS
